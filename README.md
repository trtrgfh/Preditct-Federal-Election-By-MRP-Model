# Predict Federal Election by MRP Model

# Project Overview
This project explores how increased voter turnout might have impacted the 2019 Canadian Federal Election. Using a Multilevel Regression with Poststratification (MRP) model, we predict the election outcome based on factors such as age, sex, education, marital status, and province. The goal is to determine whether higher voter participation would have altered the result, specifically if it could have led to a Conservative Party victory over the Liberal Party. The findings suggest a close race, with the Liberal Party likely maintaining a slight edge. This analysis underscores the significance of demographic factors in electoral outcomes.

# Data
The census_data.csv used can be found in the repository.

I structure this as follows - 

## Source Data
In this section, I list all of the data that was used, along with the source link and a few lines that describe each data. You can also explain each of the data attributes in greater detail if you wish.

## Data Acquisition
Data collection is not always as simple as downloading from Kaggle or any open source website; it can also be gathered through API calls or online scraping. So you can elaborate on this step in this section so that the reader can obtain the dataset by following your instructions.

## Data Preprocessing
Acquired data is not always squeaky clean, so preprocessing them are an integral part of any data analysis. In this section you can talk about the same.

# Code structure
Explain the code structure and how it is organized, including any significant files and their purposes. This will help others understand how to navigate your project and find specific components. 

Here is the basic suggested skeleton for your data science repo (you can structure your repository as needed ):

```bash
├── data
│   ├── data1.csv
│   ├── data2.csv
│   ├── cleanedData
│   │   ├── cleaneddata1.csv
|   |   └── cleaneddata2.csv
├── data_acquisition.py
├── data_preprocessing.ipynb

# Results and evaluation
Provide an overview of the results of your project, including any relevant metrics and graphs. Include explanations of any evaluation methodologies and how they were used to assess the quality of the model. You can also make it appealing by including any pictures of your analysis or visualizations.

# Future work
Outline potential future work that can be done to extend the project or improve its functionality. This will help others understand the scope of your project and identify areas where they can contribute.

# Acknowledgments/References
Acknowledge any contributors, data sources, or other relevant parties who have contributed to the project. This is an excellent way to show your appreciation for those who have helped you along the way.
